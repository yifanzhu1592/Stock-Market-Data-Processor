This project is the revised version of the group project done in the course "Programming Project" at Trinity by me and my group members: Ruxin, Matteo and Tim.

I rewrote some of the codes and comments to try to make it cleaner.

The original project: https://github.com/yifanzhu1592/Trinity-Programming-Project/tree/master/All%20programs/Group%20Project
